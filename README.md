# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
Using big data to perform an ETL process on a dataset from Amazon.
### Purpose
The purpose of this challnege was to continue our ETL process by analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program and comparing the validity of their reviews with unpaid and non-Vine reviews.
## Results
**Vine reviews vs. non-Vine reviews**
- In total, there were 647 Vine reviews and 74,113 non-Vine reviews
- For Vine reviews, there were 229 5-star reviews compared to non-Vine 5-star reviews which had 43,217 5-star reviews.
- Approximately, the percentage of Vine reviews that were 5-stars was 35.4% and for non-Vine 5-star reviews the percentage was 58.3%.

## Summary
According to the results from the analysis, there seems to be no positive bias for reviews in the Vine program as the percentage for 5-star reviews was 35.7% compared to the non-Vine 5-star reviews, which had a much higher percentage of 58.3%. One additional analysis that could be completed with the dataset to support my conclusion would be to conduct a statistical analysis which would reveal the mean, median, and mode for both types of reviews!
